Thurman (30-1-1, 22 KOs) won the secondary WBA welterweight title in 2015 and was upgraded to full champion before beating Shawn Porter in 2016. The American edged Danny Garcia in a WBA/WBC unification bout the following year, which was watched by more than 5 million viewers on CBS, making it at the time the most-viewed boxing broadcast in the U.S. in almost 20 years.

After three years out of the ring, former unified welterweight champion Keith Thurman (30-1) returns to take on local boy Brock Jarvis (22-1) at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion on March 12.

Thurman, 36, is out to prove to the fans, and himself, that he can still compete for world titles, while 27-year-old Jarvis, who will be without his long-time trainer, the legendary Jeff Fenech, seeks to forge his own path and set up blockbuster fights for the future.

In Australia, Thurman vs. Jarvis will air as a pay-per-view on Foxtel's Main Event.

The broadcast is due to begin at 5pm AEDT on Fox Sports 5 (Ch. 505), before switching to PPV at 7pm AEDT.

On Thursday, the action swings to Tokyo for a loaded card with three world championship fights. In the headliner, WBC flyweight champion Kenshiro Teraji faces WBA champion Seigo Yuri Akui in a unification bout. The WBO flyweight champion, Anthony Olascuaga, will also be in action when he defends his title against Hiroto Kyoguchi. Finally, WBO junior flyweight champion Shokichi Iwata will face former title challenger Rene Santiago.

The schedule hits a third continent on Saturday as Nick Ball defends the WBA featherweight championship against TJ Doheny in England. Doheny is no stranger to big challenges, with this his first fight since challenging undisputed junior featherweight champion Naoya Inoue.
